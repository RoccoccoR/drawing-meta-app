Certainly, here's a high-level overview of how you might structure the logic to save the drawing as a JPEG and then display it in an archive page:

Handle Save Click Logic:
When the user clicks the "Save" button, you could capture the drawing's data (such as the list of drawing commands or coordinates) and save it in a suitable data structure. This could be an array of objects, where each object represents a drawing command or a specific point in the drawing. This data structure should be saved to a database or storage solution (e.g., a backend server or a cloud storage service).

Archive Page:
Create an archive page where users can view their saved drawings. Retrieve the saved drawing data from the database or storage solution and present it on this page. To display the drawings, you would need to reconstruct the drawing by following the recorded drawing commands or coordinates and rendering them on a canvas.

Rendering Saved Drawings:
In the archive page, you'll need to loop through the saved drawing data and reapply the drawing commands to create a visual representation of the saved drawing. This could involve using the same FreeLine component logic to render the drawing commands onto a canvas.

Displaying Thumbnails or Previews:
Depending on the number of saved drawings, you might want to show thumbnails or previews of the drawings in the archive page. You can generate these thumbnails by rendering a smaller version of the drawing onto a smaller canvas.

Interaction with Archive Page:
Users can then click on a thumbnail or preview to view the full drawing, or you could implement additional interactions such as renaming, deleting, or sharing drawings.

Security and Authentication:
If the drawings are associated with specific users, you'll need to implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that users only see their own saved drawings.

Remember that this overview provides a high-level guideline. The specific implementation details will depend on your chosen backend technology, storage solutions, and the overall architecture of your application.
